This is the backend repository for the **[Animequiz](/projects/animequiz)** app. This backend is engineered using Nest.js for robust server-side architecture, PostgreSQL for a powerful relational database, and Prisma as an ORM to facilitate smooth data management and schema migration.

## üöÄ Features

- **RESTful API**: Secure and scalable endpoints for quiz data operations such as retrieve, create, update, and delete.
- **Prisma ORM**: Leverages Prisma to handle ORM tasks, simplifying database workflows and ensuring efficient data handling.
- **Supabase**: Utilizes Supabase as a provider to offer a scalable and managed PostgreSQL database.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Advanced error handling mechanisms to maintain API reliability and integrity.
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite including unit and integration tests to ensure application reliability and quality.
- **GraphQL Integration**: Integrates with the AniList GraphQL API to scrap anime data for the quiz questions.
